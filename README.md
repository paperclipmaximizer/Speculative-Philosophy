# Speculative-Philosophy
A curated list of books within the (mainly continental) tradition of speculative philosophy. The selection is designed to appeal to any experience level, but has been designed to appeal to an analytic-minded reader. 

Why suggest a Speculative Philosophy reading list specifically aimed at a Comp-Sci readership? The reason has a lot to do with game theory (GT). [sketch] GT concerns, ... , ending in a contingency view for GT orientations. Then I think I would suggest further reading as something like Girardi, or something on Linear Logic. The point is to (in reverse order) (3) supplant the game-theoretic assumptions that it assumes from classical economics, (2) build a contingency view of subjectivity to replace (what is at its heart) a kind of sober objectivism of GT,

## Contents
## Introductory Texts
_Start here if you're new to philosophy_
- Hegel in a Wired Brain
_this text serves as an excellent introduction to Hegelianism, it is fundamentally a re-presentation of the phenomenology, set in the epistemo-cosmology of computers and the culture there-in. Importantly, it is accessible_.
(The only concern I have of suggesting this first is that it may be too accessible, given the difficulty of most other things on this list).

[possible roadmap]
<!---Readers need a way in to Hegel, there are many possible routes 
1. Marx is possibly the most accessible, 
2. Technology people it could be Hegel in a wired brain, 
3. For Reading Americans it could be Russel, for 
4. Linguists possibility Kant or Neo-Kantians. 
5. People interested in Education could probably read Tubb's dialogue of the Neithammer letters, 
- it is a difficult question. When we design a course for UG we would usually use Marx since that seems the most accessible for young people, but this approach fails with anyone born before 1970's and certain people in general. Perhaps there is a need here to generalize the first chapter of HCS. In any case Hegel in a wired brain could be the best bet for now. --->
