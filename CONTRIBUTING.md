create a PR or raise an issue, the text or resource doesn't have to strictly fall within the field of speculative philosophy, it can be related to continental philosophy if it provides some specific value to speculative philosophy (think someone like Simmel)

The texts should be separated on a tripartite basis, consisting of Primary (or high quality secondary), Secondary and Tertiary texts and resources. 
Primary texts are those recognised as contributing a original speculative philosophy.
Secondary are those that involve no original insights but are nonetheless of high quality or any sort of dualist ontologies that aid in transitional readings.
Tertiary is reserved for things like Stanford encyclopedia entries, audio lectures, interviews, blog posts etc.
